	<h1>Hello World</hl>
	
	<h2>A place I would like to visit</h2>
	
	<p>As a person who loves travelling, I'd say I'd want to go everywhere,but two places that have been on my mind of where I'd like to see 
	would be Italy and Oregon. I want to go to Italy because it seems like a really nice place to wonder in. And, Oregon is a place where there
	is nature all around you, which excites me.</p>
	
	<h2> A Person I Admire</h2>
	
	<p>A person I fondly admire would be Amy Winehouse. She passed away too soon but continues to live in the hearts of her fans,friends,and 
	family. I admire her because she always did everything her way, didn't let anyone try to change her,and didn't care what anyone thought of 
	her. Her songs are ones I admire very much too.</p>
